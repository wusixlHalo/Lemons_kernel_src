# Lemons_kernel_src
- Hi, it wasn't easy to find this place, right? It's really hard for you.

- They say I copied someone else's kernel source code, where is your evidence?

- Oh turns out there is no evidence. If referencing other people's commits is considered copying source code, then all of you "developers", are you all copying? After all, you have copied Xiaomi Open Source.

- Open your shitty eyes, look at your garbage code, even adding KernelSU takes months of tinkering, are you guys not up to par or is KernelSU too advanced?

- Yes, I violated the GPL agreement by not making the kernel open source. I have too much going on and promised to open source it in July/August, may I ask if your dog eyes are reading the news only halfway?

- I should ignore your voices, because there is a gap between human and dog.

### If any of you have comments, feel free to ask me questions in issue and I'll do my best to answer them for you hh.
